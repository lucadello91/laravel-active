# Laravel-Active

Laravel helper that detects active navigation menu items and applies bootstrap classes.
This is an implementation of https://github.com/laravelista/Ekko.
In this implementation, you can use it with resouce name too.


## Installation

First, pull in the package through Composer.

```js
"require": {
    "lucadello91/laravel-active": "dev-master"
}
```

And then, if using Laravel 5 or 4, include the service provider within `app/config/app.php`.

```php
'providers' => [
    Lucadello91\Active\LaravelActiveServiceProvider::class
];
```

And, for convenience, add a facade alias to this same file at the bottom:

```php
'aliases' => [
    'Active'    => Lucadello91\Active\Facades\LaravelActive::class
];
```

## Usage

You would most likely use this package in your `navbar` partial like so:

```php
<li>
    <a href="{{ route('home') }}" class="{{ Active::isActiveRoute('home') }}">
        <i class="halflings white home"></i> Home
    </a>
</li>

<li>
    <a href="#" class="{{ Active::areActiveRoutes(['murter', 'kornati']) }}">
        <i class="halflings white screenshot"></i> Location
    </a>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="{{ route('murter') }}">Murter</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="{{ route('kornati') }}">Kornati</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>
    <a href="{{ route('trips.index') }}" class="{{ Active::isActiveMatch('trips') }}">
        <i class="halflings white road"></i> Trips
    </a>
</li>
```
